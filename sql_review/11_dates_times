CHAPTER 11 - DATES AND TIMES
---------------------------------------------------

- Date and Time Data Types

    - date = only the date
           = using the ISO 8601 YYYY-MM-DD is recommended

    - time = only the time
           = adding 'with time zone' makes the column time zone aware
           = using the ISO 8601 format HH:MM:SS is recommended
           = can add an optional time zone designator

    - timestamp = records the date and time
                = can add 'with time zone' to make the column time zone aware
                = the format 'timestamp' with time zone is part of the SQL standard
                = PostgreSQL also has the shorthand timestamptz, which has the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS TZ
                = can specify time zones in 3 different formats: UTC offset, area/location designator, 
                                                                 or standard abbreviation

    - interval = holds a value that represents a unit of time expressed in the format 'quantity unit'
               = doesnâ€™t record the start or end of a period, only its duration
               = examples include 12 days or 8 hours

    All four data types can track the system clock and the nuances of the calendar. For example, date and 
      timestamp recognize that June has 30 days. Therefore, June 31 is an invalid 'datetime' value that 
      causes the database to throw an error. Likewise, the date February 29 is valid only in a leap year, 
      such as 2020.



- Extracting the Components of a Timestamp

    # The 'date_part' function extracts a single value
    SELECT
        date_part('year', '2019-12-01 18:37:12 EST'::timestamptz) AS "year",
        date_part('month', '2019-12-01 18:37:12 EST'::timestamptz) AS "month",
        date_part('day', '2019-12-01 18:37:12 EST'::timestamptz) AS "day",
        date_part('hour', '2019-12-01 18:37:12 EST'::timestamptz) AS "hour",
        date_part('minute', '2019-12-01 18:37:12 EST'::timestamptz) AS "minute",
        date_part('seconds', '2019-12-01 18:37:12 EST'::timestamptz) AS "seconds",
        date_part('timezone_hour', '2019-12-01 18:37:12 EST'::timestamptz) AS "tz",
        date_part('week', '2019-12-01 18:37:12 EST'::timestamptz) AS "week",
        date_part('quarter', '2019-12-01 18:37:12 EST'::timestamptz) AS "quarter",
        date_part('epoch', '2019-12-01 18:37:12 EST'::timestamptz) AS "epoch";

    year    month    day    hour    minute    seconds    tz    week    quarter    epoch
    ----    -----    ---    ----    ------    -------    --    ----    -------    ----------
    2019       12      1      18        37         12    -5      48          4    1575243432


    # The SQL-standard 'extract' function does the same thing
    SELECT
        extract('year' from '2019-12-01 18:37:12 EST'::timestamptz) AS "year";



- Creating Datetime Values from Timestamp Components

    It's not unusual to come across a data set in which the year, month, and day exist in 
      separate columns.  Sometimes, it's helpful to combine them into a single datetime
      value.


    # Make datetime objects
    make_date(year, month, day)
    make_time(hour, minute, seconds)
    make_timestamp(year, month, day, hour, minute, second, time zone)


    # Examples
    SELECT make_date(2018, 2, 22);
    SELECT make_time(18, 4, 30.3);
    SELECT make_timestamptz(2018, 2, 22, 18, 4, 30.3, 'Europe/Lisbon');

    2018-02-22
    18:04:30.3
    2018-02-22 13:04:30.3-05



- Retrieving the Current Date and Time

    # Functions to get current date and time
    current_date
    current_time
    current_timestamp   OR   now()
    loacltime
    localtimestamp


    Note that these functions record the time at the start of the query, so they'll provide
      the same time throughout the execution of the query regardless of how long the query
      runs.  

    If we want to instead reflect how the clock changes during the execution of the query,
      we can use the Postgres-specific 'clock_timestamp()' function to record the current
      time as it elapses.


    # Use current_timestamp and clock_timestamp()
    CREATE TABLE current_time_example (
        time_id bigserial,
        current_timestamp_col timestamp with time zone,
        clock_timestamp_col timestamp with time zone
    );
    
    INSERT INTO current_time_example (current_timestamp_col, clock_timestamp_col)
        (SELECT current_timestamp,
                clock_timestamp()
         FROM generate_series(1,1000));
    
    SELECT * FROM current_time_example;

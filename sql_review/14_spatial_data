CHAPTER 14 - SPATIAL DATA
---------------------------------------------------

- PostGIS

    PostGIS is a free and open-source GIS database built on top of PostgreSQL.  


    # Install PostGIS
    http://postgis.net/install


    # Create DB for spatial data
    CREATE DATABASE gis_analysis;


    # Enable PostGIS extensions
    CREATE EXTENSION postgis;



- Standard Geometric 'Simple Features'

    These object types are standardized by ISO and OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium).


    Point = single location in a 2D or 3D plane
          = on maps, usually represented as (latitude, longitude)

    LineString = 2 or more points connected by a straight line
               = can represent a road, trail, or stream

    Polygon = 2D shape like a triangle or square
            = can represent objects such as nations, states, buildings, bodies of water

    MultiPoint = set of points
               = for example, can represent multiple locations of a retailer

    MultiLineString = set of linestrings
                    = can represent a road with multiple noncontiguous segments

    MultiPolygon = set of polygons
                 = can represent a parcel of land that is divided into two segments by a road



- Well-Known Text Formats

    Generally, to create a spatial object, the functions require input of 
      - a 'WKT (Well-Known Text)' string, which is text that represents a geometry
      - a 'SRID (Spatial Reference System Id)' that specifies where on the grid to place the objects

    The OGG's standard WKT format includes the geometry type and its coordinates inside one or
      more sets of parentheses.  Here, we'll use longitude/latitude pairs of coordinates.


    WKT Formats for Geometries
    -------------------------------------
    Point
    POINT (-74.9 42.7)
    A coordinate pair marking a point at âˆ’74.9 longitude and 42.7 latitude.

    LineString
    LINESTRING (-74.9 42.7, -75.1 42.7)
    A straight line with endpoints marked by two coordinate pairs.

    Polygon
    POLYGON ((-74.9 42.7, -75.1 42.7, -75.1 42.6, -74.9 42.7))
    A triangle outlined by three different pairs of coordinates. Although listed twice, the first 
      and last pair are the same coordinates, closing the shape.

    MultiPoint
    MULTIPOINT (-74.9 42.7, -75.1 42.7)
    Two Points, one for each pair of coordinates.

    MultiLineString
    MULTILINESTRING ((-76.27 43.1, -76.06 43.08), (-76.2 43.3, -76.2 43.4, -76.4 43.1))
    Two LineStrings. The first has two points; the second has three.

    MultiPolygon
    MULTIPOLYGON (((-74.92 42.7, -75.06 42.71, -75.07 42.64, -74.92 42.7), 
                   (-75.0 42.66, -75.0 42.64, -74.98 42.64, -74.98 42.66, -75.0 42.66)))
    Two Polygons. The first is a triangle, and the second is a rectangle.



- Coordinate Systems

    - Representing the Earth's spherical surface on a 2D map requires some kind of projection
        with its own 'projected coordinate system' that flattens the Earth's round surface
        to a 2D plane.

    - Most navigation apps use 'Mercator Projection', which distorts land areas close to the
        north and south poles to make them appear much larger than reality.

    - The 'Albers Projection' is most often displayed on TV screens where a map of the US is
        shown.  

    - Projections are derived from 'geographic coordinate systems', which define the grid of 
        latitude, longitude, and height of any point on the globe along with factors
        including the Earth's shape.

- Importing the Dataset

    In this chapter, we are querying a dataset that tracks education and income by county
      from 2011-2015.


    # Create table for data set
    CREATE TABLE acs_2011_2015_stats (
        geoid varchar(14) CONSTRAINT geoid_key PRIMARY KEY,
        county varchar(50) NOT NULL,
        st varchar(20) NOT NULL,
        pct_travel_60_min numeric(5, 3) NOT NULL,
        pct_bachelors_higher numeric(5, 3) NOT NULL,
        median_hh_income integer,
        CHECK (pct_masters_higher <= pct_bachelors_higher)
    );


    # Import the data set
    COPY acs_2011_2015_stats
    FROM '~/Directory/acs_2011_2015_stats.csv'
    WITH (FORMAT CSV, HEADER, DELIMITER ',');


    # Description of Columns
    pct_travel_60_min        # Percentage of workers age 16+ who communte 60+ mins to work
    pct_bachelors_higher     # Percentage of people age 25+ who have a bachelors or higher
    pct_masters_higher       # Percentage of people age 25+ who have a masters or higher
    median_hh_income         # County's median household income in 2015-adjusted dollars



- Pearson Correlation Coefficients (r)

    The Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r) is a measure for quantifying the strength of a 
      linear relationship between two variables.

      - The r values fall between -1 and 1.  
      - Either end of the range indicates a perfect correlation.
      - Values near 0 indicate a random distribution with no correlation.
      - A positive r value indicates a 'direct relationship'.
      - A negative r value indicates an 'inverse relationship'.


    Interpreting Correlation Coefficients
            0        # No relationship
      .01-.29        # Weak relationship
      .30-.59        # Moderate relationship
      .60-.99        # Strong relationship
            1        # Perfect relationship



- Measuring Correlation with corr(Y, X)

    Here, we use the corr(Y, X) function to measure correlation and investigate what 
      relationship exists, if any, between the percentage of people in a county who have 
      attained a bachelor's degree and the median household income in that county.

    The corr(Y, X) function is one of several 'binary aggregate functions' in SQL and is
      so named because these functions accept 2 inputs.  Y is the dependent variable and
      X is the independent variable.  


    # Get the correlation between bachelor's degrees and income
    SELECT corr(median_hh_income, pct_bachelors_higher) AS bachelors_income_r
    FROM acs_2011_2015_stats;

    bachelors_income_r
    ------------------
    0.682185675451399



- Checking Additional Correlations

    # Check for additional correlations with travel
    SELECT
      round(
          corr(median_hh_income, pct_bachelors_higher)::numeric, 2
          ) AS bachelors_income_r,
      round(
          corr(pct_travel_60_min, median_hh_income)::numeric, 2
          ) AS income_travel_r,
      round(
          corr(pct_travel_60_min, pct_bachelors_higher)::numeric, 2
          ) AS bachelors_travel_r
    FROM acs_2011_2015_stats;

    bachelors_income_r    income_travel_r    bachelors_travel_r
    ------------------    ---------------    ------------------

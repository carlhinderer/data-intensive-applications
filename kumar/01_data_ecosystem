|  CHAPTER 1 - EXPLORING THE DATA ECOSYSTEM                           |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- With a data lake, data that is collected is seldom processed prior to being stored.  This is
    because any processing may cause a loss of some information.

  This doesn't mean that data doesn't get processed.  It means one copy is stored in the manner in
    which it was received from the external system.


- For a long time, organizations were technology-driven.  New organizations are becoming 
    data-driven.


- Contextual information about the places the data came from is extrememly important.  We
    must know about the relevance and reliability of the data sources.  We should also
    understand the entire lineage of the data.  

  In data-driven organizations, the 'Data Evangelist' will drive this understanding.


- Nowadays, data comes from a variety of sources, at varying speeds, and in a number of
    different formats.

  A few examples of sources:

      - CRM structured data
      - Social media
      - Sensors
      - Events
      - Mobile
      - Automobiles
      - Machine data
      - Weather
      - Security access
      - Contracts and regulatory


- 3 Categories of Data

    1. Structured data
         Has a schema (ie XML)

    2. Semi-structured data
         Does not have a formal schema (ie web server logs)

    3. Unstructured data
         Hard to derive any structure (audio and video files, blog posts)


- Whenever we collect data from an external source, there is always a clause about how that
    data can be used.  This becomes very important when data is shared between organizations.
    For instance, how can data about cyber threats be used?

  There are many ways in which this sharing can be agreed upon by organizations.  2 such ways
    include:

    1. Traffic Light Protocol (RED, AMBER, GREEN, WHITE)

    2. Information Exchange Policy Framework (IEPF) from first.org
         [Example: ENCRYPT IN TRANSIT, ENCRYPT IN REST, PERMITTED ACTIONS,
                   AFFECTED PARTY NOTIFICATIONS, OBFUSCATE AFFECTED PARTIES,
                   UNMODIFIED RESALE OF DATA IS ALLOWED]


- The 3 Vs

    1. Volume
    2. Variety
    3. Velocity


- A company has 2 reasons it might want to collect some data.

    1. The organization wants to use the data to improve its own systems and processes.

    2. The organization wants to place itself strategically in a situation where it can
         generate new opportunities for itself.



- Use Case #1 - Security

    - Until a few years ago, the best way to combat external cyber security threats was to 
        create a series of firewalls that were assumed to be impenetrable.

      To combat internal attacks, antivirus software was considered to be sufficient.

      This traditional defense mostly gave the illusion of security.  Looking for 'known bad
        signatures' didn't help in combating APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats).


    - As systems develop in complexity, coordinated hacking attacks persisted over a long 
        period and exploited every aspect of vulnerable systems.


    - For instance, a use case in the security domain is 'Anomaly Detection', which looks for
        any non-homogenous event or transaction in a seemingly homogenous series of events.

      As an example, banks look through credit card transactions for suspicious transactions.
        Then a wide variety of organizations created hunting teams to look at various data for
        anomalies.


    - The main challenges when trying to create these hunting teams:

        1. Data is scattered throughout the organization
        2. Data quality issues and multiple data versioning issues
        3. Access and contractual limitations


    - All of these requirements and challenges drive the need for a platform that is capable of:

        1. Long-term data retention
        2. Correlating different data sources
        3. Providing fast access to correlated data
        4. Real-time analysis



- Use Case #2 - Modem Data Collection

    - A large telecom company provides modems to its clients for high-speed internet access.  It
        purchases these modems from 4 different vendors and distributes them under its brand.


    - The company receives 100 calls a day about the modem not working.  They have to handle 
        calls and send replacements to customers, all at the company's expense.  

      The company has found that 90% of the modems work fine and the actual problem is faulty or
        incorrect setup.


    - In order to take a proactive approach to this problem, the company will collect anonymous
        data from each modem once a second, and the modem will send about 1KB of data each time.

      With one million modems, this amounts to 1 GB/s, with 86 TB of total data generated each 
        day.  


    - The company needs a system capable of fast ingenstion and quick real-time analysis.

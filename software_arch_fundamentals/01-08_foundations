- 4 Dimensions of architecture
    1. Characteristics = nonfunctional requirements (ie scalability)
    2. Structure = style of implementation (ie microservices)
    3. Decisions = rules for how a system should be constructed (ie only service can access DB)
    4. Principles = guidelines rather than rules (ie use REST between services)

- Archicture Characteristics
    - Availability
    - Reliability
    - Testability
    - Scalability
    - Security
    - Agility
    - Fault Tolerance
    - Elasciticy
    - Recoverability
    - Performance
    - Deployability
    - Learnability

- Expectations of an Architect
    1. Make architecture decisions
    2. Continually analyze the architecture
    3. Keep current with the latest trends
    4. Ensure compliance with decisions
    5. Diverse exposure and expreience
    6. Have business domain knowledge
    7. Possess interpersonal skills
    8. Understand and navigate politics

- Milestones
    - XP (1996) = agile principles and test-first
    - 'Continuous Delivery' (2010) = automation, testing, CI, single source of truth

- Architecture Concerns
    - Requirements
    - Auditability
    - Performance
    - Security
    - Data
    - Legality
    - Scalability

- New Additions to Architecture Discipline

    - DevOps now included
    - Process
    - Data (and the increasingly complex set of data options)

- Laws of Software Architecture
    1. Everything in software architecture is a trade-off.
    C. If you don't see the trade-off, you haven't discovered it yet.
    2. Why is more important than how.

| 2. ARCHITECTURAL THINKING                                        |
--------------------------------------------------------------------

- Switching from technical depth to breadth is one of the hardest parts of making
    the transition from a developer to an architect.

- Tradoffs Example
    - Send message to topic
                                        Bid Capture
                                     /
         Bid Producer ---->  Topic  --  Bid Tracking
                                     \ 
                                        Bid Analytics

         A change can be made in a single place and services are decoupled.  However, 
           the lack of monitoring information exposed makes it harder to auto-scale.  
           Also, there might be security issues since anyone can subscribe.

    - Send messages to separate AMQP queues

                            Queue ----> Bid Capture
                         / 
         Bid Producer ----> Queue ----> Bid Tracking
                         \
                            Queue ----> Bid Analytics

         Changes have to be made in multiple places.  Also, we have to send multiple
           messages if multiple services need to be notified of an event.  But, it 
           is easier to control subscribers and get monitoring information.

- An architect must do hands-on coding regularly.  It is usually a good idea for them
    not to be the blocker on a critical change.

| 3. MODULARITY                                                    |
--------------------------------------------------------------------

- History of Modular Reuse
    - Dijkstra's 'Goto Statement Considered Harmful' (1967)
    - Structured Languages like C and Pascal (Early 1970s)
    - Modular languages like Modula and Ada (Mid 1970s)
    - OOP languages (Early 1980s)

- Cohesion = related parts should be packaged together
    - Dividing a cohesive module would result in increased coupling, decreased readability
    - Automated checker can look at which instance variables used by which methods

- Example of Tradeoff

    - One module

        Customer Maintenance
          > add customer
          > update customer
          > get customer
          > notify customer
          > get customer orders
          > cancel customer orders

    - Split into 2 modules

        Customer Maintenance
          > add customer
          > update customer
          > get customer
          > notify customer

        Order Maintenance
          > get customer orders
          > cancel customer orders

- Coupling = Can be analyzed by looking at cyclomatic complexity in the call graph

- Abstractness = ratio of abstract types to concrete

- Instability = ratio of outgoing coupling to outgoing and incoming coupling

- Connascence = changing one requirement involves changing other components to
                  maintain correctness of the system

- Using Connascence to Improve Modularity
    1. Minimize overall connascence by breaking system into encapsulated elements
    2. Minimize remaining connascence that crosses encapsulation boundaries
    3. Maximize connascence within encapsulation boundaries





--------------------------------------------------------------------
| 4. ARCHITECTURAL CHARACTERISTICS                                 |
--------------------------------------------------------------------

- An architectural characteristic

    1. Specifies a nondomain (aka nonfunctional) design consideration
    2. Influences some structural aspect of the design
    3. Is critical or important to application success

- Operational Characteristics
    - Availability
    - Continuity (disaster recovery capability)
    - Performance (stress testing, response times, etc)
    - Recoverability (backups and duplicated hardware)
    - Reliability/Safety (will people die?)
    - Robustness (will it keep working if power or internet fails?)
    - Scalability

- Structural Characteristics
    - Configurability
    - Extensibility
    - Installability
    - Localization
    - Maintainability
    - Portability
    - Reusability
    - Supportability
    - Upgradability

- Cross-Cutting Architectural Characteristics
    - Accessibility
    - Archivability
    - Authentication
    - Authorization
    - Legal
    - Privacy
    - Security (encryption at rest, encryption in transit, remote access)
    - Supportability
    - Usability

- Tradeoffs and Least Worst Architecture
    - ie Security degrades Performance
    - Can usually support only a handful of characteristics in one system





--------------------------------------------------------------------
| 5. IDENTIFYING ARCHITECTURAL CHARACTERISTICS                     |
--------------------------------------------------------------------

- Architects uncover architectural characteristics by:
    1. Extracting from domain concerns
    2. Extracting from requirements
    3. Extracting from implicit domain knowledge

- There are several architecture katas websites that are great for practicing 
    translating domain requirements to architectural priorities.


- Examples of translating domain concerns to architectural characteristics   

    Domain Concerns                Architecture characteristics
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Mergers and acquisitions       Interoperability, scalability, adaptability, 
                                     extensibility

    Time to market                 Agility, testability, deployability

    User satisfaction              Performance, availability, fault tolerance, 
                                     testability, deployability, agility, security

    Competitive advantage          Agility, testability, deployability, scalability, 
                                     availability, fault tolerance

    Time and budget                Simplicity, feasibility


- Security is an example of an explicit characteristic in every system.  No one wants
    to create insecure software.  However, it must always be balanced against other
    priorities.

  Performance is another one.  No one wants to visit a slow website, but performance is
    a nuanced concept and this must also be balanced against other priorities.


- There are no wrong answers in architecture, only expensive ones!

| 6. MEASURING & GOVERNANCE                                        |
--------------------------------------------------------------------

- Problems with defining architectural definitions
    1. They aren't physics
    2. Wildly varying definitions
    3. Too composite

- Operational measurements are things that can be measured directly.
    - Response times
    - Time until webpage rendering starts
    - First CPU idle on mobile
    - Outlier requests that take longer
    - Statistical analysis that drills down further instead of only looking at mean

- Structural measurements like modularity are harder to measure.
    - Cyclomatic complexity can be measured by creating a graph of all the function
        calls and see which classes/functions have too many decision points.

- Process measurements are for things associated with the development process.
    - Code coverage
    - Percentage of successful deployments
    - How long deployments take

- Fitness Function = objective assessment of some architecture characteristic
    - Check for cyclic dependencies (ie JDepend)
    - Distance from the main sequence (also JDepend)
    - Unit tests for architecture keep bad designs out of code base (ie ArchUnit)

- Netflix's Simian Army
    - Conformity Monkey = checks for architectural governance rules
    - Security Monkey = checks each service for well-known security defects
    - Janitor Monkey = looks for instances no service routes to anymore, can be decommed
    - Chaos Monkey = high latency situations, data centers going down, etc.

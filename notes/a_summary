Part 1: Foundations of Data Systems

  1. Introducing Terminology
     Discussion of Reliability, Scalability, and Maintainability

  2. Comparison of Different Data Models and Query Languages
     Databases from a Developer's Point of View

  3. Internals of Storage Engines and How Databases Lay Out Data on Disk

  4. Various Formats for Data Encoding (Serialization)
     How the Different Formats Fare When Schemas Change Over Time


Part 2: Distributed Data
        What Happens If Multiple Machies Are Involved With Storage and Retrieval of Data

  5. Replication
     Having Multiple Copies of the Data on Different Nodes

  6. Partitioning
     The Need to Break Up Large Datasets Into Partitions (aka Sharding)

  7. Transactions
     Issues With Grouping Several Reads and Writes Together Into a Logical Unit

  8. Problems With Distributed Systems
     Hardware Failures, Unreliable Systems, Unreliable Clocks

  9. Consistency and Consensus
     Examples of Algorithms and Protocols For Building Distributed Systems
     Seek Abstractions That Can Allow an Application to Ignore Distributed System Problems

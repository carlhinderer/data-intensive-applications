- Inserting Documents

    - To insert a single document, the 'insertOne' method is used.

        > db.movies.insertOne({'title': 'Stand By Me'})


    - To insert multiple documents, the 'insertMany' method is used.  Instead of making a round trip to
        the database for each insert, they will be inserted in bulk.

        > db.movies.insertMany([{'title': 'Ghostbusters'},
                                {'title': 'E.T.'},
                                {'title': 'Blade Runner'}]);


    - Current versions of Mongo don't support messages longer than 48 MB, so there is a hard limit to how
        many inserts can be done at one time.  If you try to insert more than 48MB, many drivers will split
        your insert into multiple 48MB operations.


    - There are 2 options for dealing with errors that occur during 'insertMany' operations.

        1. If we specify 'true' for the 'ordered' key, the insert will ensure that the documents are
             inserted in the order they are provided.  If a document produces an error during the insert,
             no documents beyond that point in the array will be inserted.  This is the default option
             for 'insertMany'.

        2. If we specfiy 'false' for the 'ordered' key, Mongo may reorder the inserts to improve
             performance.  If an error occurs, the insert operation will keep trying to insert as many
             documents as possible.


        // Unordered insertMany, fails since the ids are duplicated
        > db.movies.insertMany([
            {'_id' : 3, 'title' : 'Sixteen Candles'},
            {'_id' : 4, 'title' : 'The Terminator'},
            {'_id' : 4, 'title' : 'The Princess Bride'},
            {'_id' : 5, 'title' : 'Scarface'}],
          {'ordered': false})


    - The validation done on insert operations is minimal.  It checks the document's basic structure, adds
        an '_id' field if one does not exist, and makes sure all documents are less than 16 MB.


    - In Mongo versions <3.0, the 'insert' operation was the primary method for inserting documents.  As
        of Mongo 3.2, this is still suppored for backwards compatibility.

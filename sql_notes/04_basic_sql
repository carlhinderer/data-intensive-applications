- SQL Data Types

    - Numeric Types

        INTEGER or INT
        SMALLINT

        FLOAT or REAL
        DOUBLE PRECISION

        DECIMAL(i,j) or DEC(i,j) or NUMERIC(i,j)


    - Character types

        CHAR(n) or CHARACTER(n)
        VARCHAR(n)


    - Bit Types

        BIT(n)
        BIT VARYING(n)
        BLOB


    - Boolean Type

        BOOL


    - Datetime Types

        DATE [WITH TIME ZONE]
        TIME [WITH TIME ZONE]
        TIMESTAMP
        INTERVAL


    - User-Defined Types

        CREATE DOMAIN SSN_TYPE AS CHAR(9);



- Naming Constraints

    Constraints can have a name for convenience, but they don't have to.

    # Valid
    PRIMARY KEY (Ssn)
    FOREIGN KEY (Superssn) REFERENCES EMPLOYEE (Ssn)


    # Also Valid
    CONSTRAINT EMPLOYEE_PK PRIMARY KEY (Ssn)
    CONSTRAINT EMP_SUP_FK FOREIGN KEY (Superssn) REFERENCES EMPLOYEE (Ssn)



- Setting Defaults

    # Set a default value for an attribute
    Mgr_ssn     CHAR(9)      NOT NULL       DEFAULT '9999999999'



- Check constraints

    # Set a check constraint for an attribute
    CHECK (D_NUM > 0 AND D_NUM < 21)



- Foreign Key Triggers

    - Referential integrity can be violated when tuples are deleted or inserted.  The default action that
        SQL takes for an integrity violation is to reject the update operation that will cause a violation.
        This is known as the RESTRICT option.


    - However, an alternative action can be specified by attaching a referential triggered action.  The
        options are:

        - SET NULL
        - CASCADE
        - SET DEFAULT

      An option must be qualified with:

        - ON DELETE
        - ON UPDATE


    - For instance, if the employee's supervisor is set as

        FOREIGN KEY (Super_ssn) REFERENCES EMPLOYEE (Ssn)
        ON DELETE SET NULL
        ON UPDATE CASCADE

      If the supervisor tuple is deleted, the value of 'Superssn' is set to NULL.
      If the supervisor tuple is updated, the value of 'Superssn' is set to the new value.


    - The ON DELETE CASCADE option means that if a tuple is deleted, all referencing tuples are deleted
        also.



- Query Example #1 - Join Condition in WHERE Clause

    # Retrieve the name and address of all employees who work for the research department

    SELECT Fname, Lname, Address
    FROM EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT
    WHERE Dname = 'Research' 
      AND Dnumber = Dno;



- Query Example #2 - Two Join Conditions in WHERE Clause

    # For every project located in 'Stafford', list the project number, the controlling dept number,
    #   and the dept managers last name, address, and birth date

    SELECT Pnumber, Dnum, Lname, Address, Bdate
    FROM PROJECT, DEPARTMENT, EMPLOYEE
    WHERE Dnumber = Dnum 
      AND Mgr_ssn = Ssn 
      AND Plocation = 'Stafford;



- Query Example #3 - Aliasing Relations

    # For each employee, retrieve the employee's first and last name, and retrieve the first and last
    #   name of their supervisor

    SELECT E.Fname, E.Lname, S.Fname, S.Lname
    FROM EMPLOYEES AS E, EMPLOYEES AS S
    WHERE E.Super_ssn = S.Ssn;



- Query Example #4 - Fully-Qualified Attributes

    SELECT EMPLOYEE.Fname, EMPLOYEE.Lname, EMPLOYEE.Address
    FROM EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT
    WHERE DEPARTMENT.Dname = 'Research'
      AND DEPARTMENT.Dnumber = EMPLOYEE.Dno;



- Query Example #5 - Asterisk Queries

    # Get all attributes for employees in dept 5
    SELECT *
    FROM EMPLOYEE
    WHERE Dno=5;


    # Get all attributes of employees and their departments for the Research dept
    SELECT *
    FROM EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT
    WHERE Dname = 'Research' AND Dno = Dnumber;


    # Get the cross product of the employee and department relations
    SELECT *
    FROM EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT;



- Query Example #6 - Distinct Values

    # Get all the unique salaries for employees
    SELECT DISTINCT Salary
    FROM EMPLOYEE;



- Query Example #7 - UNION Operation

    # Get all the project numbers for projects that involve an employee whose last name is 'Smith',
    #   either as a worker or as a manager of the department that controls the project

      (SELECT DISTINCT Pnumber
       FROM PROJECT, DEPARTMENT, EMPLOYEE,
       WHERE Dnum = Dnumber AND Mgr_ssn = Ssn AND Lname = 'Smith')
    UNION
      (SELECT DISTINCT Pnumber
       FROM PROJECT, WORKS_ON, EMPLOYEE
       WHERE Pnumber = Pno AND Essn = Ssn AND Lname = 'Smith')



- List of SQL Set Operations

    # Standard set operations
    UNION         Set union
    EXCEPT        Set difference
    INTERSECT     Set intersection

    # Multiset operations (don't remove duplicates)
    UNION ALL
    EXCEPT ALL
    INTERSECT ALL

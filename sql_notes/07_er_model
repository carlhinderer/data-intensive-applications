- Stages of Database Design

    1. Requirements Collection and Analysis

         We collect the user-defined operations that will be applied, including retrievals and updates.


    2. Conceptual Design

         We create a high-level model, which includes the entity types, relationships, and constraints.
           We can also define the high-level queries.


    3. Logical Design

         Here, we implement the database in a RDBMS.


    4. Physical Design

         Here, the internal storage structures, file organizations, indexes, access paths, and physical
           design parameters for the database files are specified.



- Sample Database Application

    Our sample database application, called COMPANY, will be used to demonstrate the ER concepts.  The
      COMPANY database keeps track of a company's employees, departments, and projects.

      1. The company is organized into departments.  Each department has a unique name, a unique number,
           and a single employee who manages the department.  We keep track of the start date when the
           employee started managing the department.  A department may have several locations.

      2. A department controls a number of projects, each of which has a unique name, a unique number,
           and a single location.

      3. We store each employee's name, SSN, address, salary, sex, and birth date.  An employee is 
           assigned to one department, but may work on several projects, which are not necessarily
           controlled by the same department.  We keep track of the current number of hours per week
           that an employee works on each project.  We also keep track of the direct supervisor of the
           employee.

      4. We want to keep track of the dependents of each employee for insurance purposes.  We keep each
           employee's first name, sex, birth date, and relationship to the employee.

CHAPTER 5 - MORE SQL
----------------------------------------------------

- Checking for NULL in Queries

    # Get the list of employees that don't have supervisors
    SELECT Fname, Lname
    FROM EMPLOYEE
    WHERE Super_ssn IS NULL



- Nested Queries with the IN Function

    # The IN operator compares a value with a set and evaluates to TRUE if the value is in the set
    SELECT DISTINCT Pnumber
    FROM PROJECT
    WHERE Pnumber IN (
        SELECT Pnumber
        FROM PROJECT, DEPARTMENT, EMPLOYEE
        WHERE Dnum = Dnumber AND Mgr_ssn = Ssn AND Lname = 'Smith')


    # IN operator with a tuple
    SELECT DISTINCT Essn
    FROM WORKS_ON
    WHERE (Pno, Hours) IN (SELECT Pno, Hours
                           FROM WORKS_ON
                           WHERE Essn = '222334444')



- The ALL Function

    # Return employees whose salary is greater than all employees in Dept 5
    SELECT Lname, Fname
    FROM EMPLOYEE
    WHERE Salary > ALL (SELECT Salary
                        FROM EMPLOYEE
                        WHERE Dno = 5)



- The EXISTS Function

    The EXISTS function is used to check whether the results of a nested query are empty.


    # Get all employees who have dependents with the same name and sex as the employee
    SELECT E.Fname, E.Lname
    FROM EMPLOYEE AS E, DEPENDENT AS D
    WHERE E.Ssn = D.Essn AND E.Sex = D.Sex AND E.Fname = D.Dependent_name


    # The same query using IN
    SELECT E.Fname, E.Lname
    FROM EMPLOYEE AS E
    WHERE E.Ssn IN (SELECT Essn
                    FROM DEPENDENT AS D
                    WHERE E.Fname = D.Dependent_name AND E.Sex = D.Sex)


    # The same query using EXISTS
    SELECT E.Fname, E.Lname
    FROM EMPLOYEE AS E
    WHERE EXISTS (SELECT *
                  FROM DEPENDENT
                  WHERE Ssn = Essn)



- Using NOT EXISTS

    # Get names of employees who have no dependents
    SELECT Fname, Lname
    FROM EMPLOYEE
    WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT *
                      FROM DEPENDENT
                      WHERE Ssn = Essn)



- More EXISTS and NOT EXISTS Examples

    # List the names of managers who have at least one dependent
    SELECT Fname, Lname
    FROM EMPLOYEE
    WHERE EXISTS (SELECT *
                  FROM DEPENDENT
                  WHERE Ssn = Essn)
          AND
          EXISTS (SELECT *
                  FROM DEPARTMENT
                  WHERE Ssn = Mgr_ssn)


    # Get the name of each employee who works on all projects controlled by Dept 5
    #   Note: EXCEPT will cause query to return of results of 1st subquery MINUS results of 2nd subquery

    SELECT Fname, Lname
    FROM EMPLOYEE
    WHERE NOT EXISTS (( SELECT Pnumber
                        FROM PROJECT
                        WHERE Dnum = 5)
                        EXCEPT (
                            SELECT Pno
                            FROM WORKS_ON
                            WHERE Ssn = Essn) )



- Renaming Attributes

    SELECT E.Lname AS Employee_name, S.Lname AS Supervisor_name
    FROM EMPLOYEE AS E, EMPLOYEE AS S
    WHERE E.Super_ssn = S.Ssn



- Joins

    - Joins were incorporated into SQL to allow users to specify a table resulting from a join operation
        in the FROM clause, rather than the WHERE clause.  The default join type is an INNER JOIN, where
        a tuple is included in the result only if a matching tuple exists in the other relation.

        # Get all employees in the Research department
        SELECT Fname, Lname, Address
        FROM EMPLOYEE 
             JOIN DEPARTMENT ON Dno = Dnumber
        WHERE Dname = 'Research'


    - With a NATURAL JOIN, no join condition is specified.  An implicit EQUIJOIN condition for each
        pair of attributes with the same name in the 2 relations is created.

        SELECT Fname, Lname, Address
        FROM EMPLOYEE
             NATURAL JOIN DEPARTMENT AS DEPT (Dname, Dno, Mssn, Msdate)
        WHERE Dname = 'Research'


    - With a LEFT OUTER JOIN, all tuples from the left relation are included, whether they have a 
        matching tuple in the right relation or not.  If they do not, NULL is returned for the attributes
        from the right relation.

        # Return all employees, whether they have a supervisor or not
        SELECT E.Lname AS Employee_name,
               S.Lname AS Supervisor_name
        FROM EMPLOYEE AS E 
             LEFT OUTER JOIN EMPLOYEE AS S ON E.Super_ssn = S.Ssn


    - With a RIGHT OUTER JOIN, all tuples from the right relation are included, whether they have a 
        matching tuple in the left relation or not.  If it does not, NULL is returned for the attributes
        from the left relation.


    - With a FULL OUTER JOIN, all tuples from both relations are included.  They have NULL for the 
        attributes they don't have a matching tuple for on either the left or right side.


    - A CROSS JOIN returns the full Cartesian product of the 2 relations.  All possible combinations
        of tuples from the relations are returned.


    - Joins can also be multiway, with 3 or more relations included.

        SELECT Pnumber, Dnum, Lname, Address, Bdate
        FROM PROJECT
             JOIN DEPARTMENT ON Dnum = Dnumber
             JOIN EMPLOYEE ON Mgr_ssn = Ssn
        WHERE Plocation = 'Stafford'

CHAPTER 6 - RELATIONAL ALGEBRA AND CALCULUS
----------------------------------------------------

- Formal Languages

    - There are 2 formal languages for the relational model: relational algebra and relational calculus.
        SQL is the practical language for the relational model.  It is based on these earlier formal
        languages.


    - Relational Algebra provides a basic set of operations for retrieving requests from a relational
        model.  It is used to implement, process, and optimize queries in a RDBMS.  It describes the
        sequence of operations used to retrieve a result.


    - Relational Calculus provides a higher-level declarative language for specifying relational queries.
        There is no order of operations, just what the result should contain.



- The SELECT Operation

    We can think of selection as a filtering operation that only keeps the tuples that specify a given
      condition.


      SELECT[Dno=4] (EMPLOYEE)

      SELECT[Salary > 30000] (EMPLOYEE)



- The PROJECT Operation

    Whereas selection filters tuples, projection filters attributes.  The PROJECT operation also removes
      any duplicate tuples, producing a valid set.


      PROJECT[Lname, Fname, Salary] (EMPLOYEE)



- Combining SELECT and PROJECT

    For most queries, we need to apply several relational operations, one after another.


      PROJECT[Fname, Lname, Salary] (SELECT[Dno = 5] (EMPLOYEE))



- The RENAME Operation

    We can also rename any relation for convenience.

      TEMP <- SELECT[Dno = 5] (EMPLOYEE)

      PROJECT[Fname, Lname, Salary] (TEMP)
